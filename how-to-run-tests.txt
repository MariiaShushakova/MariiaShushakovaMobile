2)To enable some additional functions in Developer options screen:
- enable “Debugging”
- enable “USB debugging In addition, change “USB configuration” to MTP In case you cannot recognize your device on PC move “USB configuration” to PTP than it will be automatically changed to MTP (respective value)
